## The scenario
**Once upon a time** when a human rights organization published a sensitive report exposing wrongdoing, they had to immediately brace for an online backlash from powerful actors who wanted to discredit them.

**Every day** when a human rights organization published a sensitive report exposing wrongdoing, they had to immediately brace for an online backlash from powerful actors who wanted to discredit them.

**One day...** (what will you do to address the problems and challenges being faced?)

**Because of that...** (what changes will your solution bring?)

**Until finally...** human rights organizations no longer had to improvise their defense while under attack. When a crisis hit, their team could act calmly and strategically, and the attacks became useful evidence for their advocacy, increasing visibility and public support for their work while reducing the impact of malicious actors.
