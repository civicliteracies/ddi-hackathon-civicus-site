## The scenario
**Once upon a time** fact-checking teams completing investigations were left with very little time or resources to ensure that their work reached a wide audience on social media, which had become an important discussion space in which citizens formed opinions. 

**Every day** they would struggle to come up with social-media friendly formats to share their articles, while the misleading images or fake news they were fighting against kept reaching more people. This was a challenge of resources, but also of ethics: resorting to clickbait was not a solution.

</Modal>

**One day...** (what will you do to address the problems and challenges being faced?)

**Because of that...** (what changes will your solution bring?)

**Until finally...** their work started to see levels of engagements similar to the fake news they were debunking, while keeping a distinct identity. This led to more balanced social media conversations, supported by empowered users who used their publications to warn others in comment sections.
