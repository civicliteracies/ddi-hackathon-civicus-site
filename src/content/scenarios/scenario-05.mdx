## The scenario
**Once upon a time** when a young activist felt strongly about a cause, their first impulse was often to think: 'We should do something!'

**Every day** this initial energy would fade when faced with hard questions. They struggled to imagine an event that was both meaningful and realistic, and found it difficult to convince their friends to commit to a vague idea. The conversation would often end with 'let's think about it more,' and the momentum would be lost.

**One day...** (what will you do to address the problems and challenges being faced?)

**Because of that...** (what changes will your solution bring?)

**Until finally...** the path from a passionate idea to a concrete plan of action became clear and accessible. Young activists could quickly develop their initial thoughts into compelling event concepts that inspired their peers to join them, leading to a new wave of creative and meaningful youth-led events, and a stronger pipeline of politically active young citizens.
