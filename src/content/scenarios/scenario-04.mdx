## The scenario
**Once upon a time** youth-led CSO staff would spend their days deeply engaged in their cause, from organizing protests to researching policy. 

**Every day** they would scroll through their social media feeds and see their friends sharing memes and lighthearted entertainment. This created a painful feeling of disconnect, as they struggled with how to talk about the serious issues they cared about without sounding preachy or alienating the peers they wanted to connect with.

**One day...** (what will you do to address the problems and challenges being faced?)

**Because of that...** (what changes will your solution bring?)

**Until finally...** youth-led campaigns had a reliable stream of creative ideas for connecting their serious issues to what was trending. This allowed them to consistently produce relevant content that their peers found genuinely entertaining and sharable. Activism started to feel less like a lecture and more like a clever and unmissable part of online culture, drawing in a new audience that had previously felt alienated from social causes.
