## The scenario
**Once upon a time** fact-checking teams regularly encountered stories that involved people or events from neighbouring countries, forcing them to research information in a language other than their own, which included research on which websites or forums were relevant to their investigation.

**Every day** they had to slowly work through a lot of content using translation tools, or with the help of local contacts who often could not respond quickly enough, leading to a loss of precious time during which fake news or unverified information kept being spread in the population. The inefficiency was demotivating for them and their foreign colleagues, making it harder to prioritize cross-border stories.

**One day...** (what will you do to address the problems and challenges being faced?)

**Because of that...** (what changes will your solution bring?)

**Until finally...** fact-checkers became able to investigate cross-border stories almost as fast as they would for local issues. Over time, the speedy debunking of cross-border fake news led to a decrease in negative opinions and stereotypes about other countries circulating among the public and politicians became more wary of sharing unverified news as their audience had become more distrustful.

<ul>
  <li>Map common sources of cross-border misinformation in EECA countries.</li>
  <li>Identify existing language barriers and available translation/localization tools.</li>
  <li>Consider secure, real-time communication channels for fact-checking teams.</li>
  <li>Build solutions that integrate with existing verification workflows rather than replacing them.</li>
  <li>Ensure scalability across multiple countries and adaptability to changing disinfo tactics.</li>
</ul>

#### Solution users and audience
<ul>
  <li>Fact-checking organizations in EECA countries</li>
